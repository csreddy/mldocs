### **ML Docs**<sup>_lite_</sup>

[MarkLogic](http://www.marklogic.com/) has over 3000 apis, its very hard to quicky and accurately find the api you are looking for. More often than not you just want to lookup the api, learn about it and get back to work. [Docs](http://docs.marklogic.com/) portal does not really help in that case. It has a clumsy UI and often is too slow to access.  It requires the user to type the exact key word to narrow the results. Its a huge hinderance especially for new marklogic developers who are not really aware of the all the apis or the relevant names.

**ML Docs**<sup>_lite_</sup> tries to solve this problem with a simple, light weight and clean interface, that’ll enable you to quickly and accurately locate the api at lightning speed, whether you are online or __offline!__

#####highlights

+ Offline search, the user can save the docs for later usage to access, even when they are on a plane or inside a cave!
+ Clean interface to quickly find the api you are looking for instead of using docs.marklogic.com which is often too slow and does event return the correct results sometimes
+ Using fuzzy search,  you don’t need to type exact names, it will help narrow down the results as you type
